                        <div>
                            <p>The Study of number system is important from the viewpoint of understanding how data are
                                represented before they can be processed by any digital system including a digital computer.
                                It is one of the most basic topics in digital electronics. In this chapter we will discuss
                                different number systems commonly used to represent data. We will begin the discussion with
                                the decimal number system. <br> Although it is not important for the viewpoint of digital
                                electronics, a brief outline of this will be given to explain some of the underlying
                                concepts used in other number systems. This will then be followed by the more commonly used
                                number systems such as the binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems.</p>

                                <h3>Number System:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Decimal Number System: The Decimal Number System is a radix - 10 number system an
                                        dtherfore has 10 different digits or symbols. These are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
                                        and 9. <br> The Place value of different digits in a mixed decimal number, starting
                                        from the decimal point are 10 <sup>0</sup>, 10 <sup>1</sup>, 10 <sup>2</sup> and so
                                        on (for the integer part) and 10 <sup>-1</sup>, 10 <sup>-2</sup>, 10 <sup>-3</sup>
                                        and so on (for the fractional part). <br> The value or magnitude of a given decimal
                                        number can be expressed as the sum of the various digits multiplied by their place
                                        values or weights. <br> As an Illustration, in the case of decimal number 3586.265
                                        the integer part (i.e. 3586) can be expressed as <br> 3586 = 6*10<sup>0</sup> +
                                        8*10<sup>1</sup> + 5*10<sup>2</sup> + 3*10<sup>3</sup> = 6 + 80 + 500 + 3000 = 3586
                                        and the fractional part can be expressed as 265 = 2*10<sup>-1</sup> +
                                        6*10<sup>-2</sup> + 5*10<sup>-3</sup> = 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.005 = 0.265</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Binary Number System: The Binary System is radix - 2 number system with '0' and '1'
                                        as the two independent digits. Binary Number are 2<sup>0</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>,
                                        2<sup>2</sup> and so on (for the integer part) and 2<sup>-1</sup>, 2<sup>-2</sup>,
                                        2<sup>-3</sup> and so on (for the fractional part).</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Octal Number System: The Octal Number System is the radix of the 8 and therefore has
                                        eight distinct digits. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. We make Higher Number Combination
                                        with the help of combination of these 8 numbers. In Fact, if we omit all the number
                                        containng the digits 8 or 9, or both, from the decimal number system, we end up with
                                        an octal number system. The place values for the different digits int he octal
                                        number system are 8<sup>0</sup>, 8<sup>1</sup>, 8<sup>2</sup> and so on (for the
                                        integer part) and 8<sup>-1</sup>, 8<sup>-2</sup>, 8<sup>-3</sup> and so on (for the
                                        fractional part).</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Hexadecimal Number System: The Hexadecimal number system is a radix - 16 number
                                        system and its 16 basic digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and
                                        F. The place values or weights of different digits in a mixed hexadecimal number are
                                        16<sup>0</sup>, 16<sup>1</sup>, 16<sup>2</sup> and so on (for the integer part) and
                                        16<sup>-1</sup>, 16<sup>-2</sup>, 16<sup>-3</sup> and so on (for the fractional
                                        part). The decimal equivalent of A, B, C, D, E and F are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
                                        respectively.</li>

                                <p>1. Binary Number System: Binary Number System uses only two digits 0's and 1's the
                                    numbers in this system have a base of 2. Digits 0 and 1 are called Bits and 8-Bits
                                    together made one byte.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>For Example: (11101)<sub>2</sub></p>
                                <br>
                                <p>2. Decimal Number System: Decimal Number System uses 10 digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
                                    9 with the base number as 10. The Decimal Number System is the system that we generally
                                    used to represent numbers in real life if any number is represented without base, It
                                    means that its base is 10.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>For Example: (723)<sub>10</sub></p>
                                <br>
                                <p>3. Octal Number System: The Octal Number System uses 8 digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 with
                                    the base of 8. The Advantage of this system is that it has lesser digits when compare to
                                    several other system digits. There would be fewer computational errors. Digits like 8
                                    and 9 are not included in octal number system. Just as binary, octal number system is
                                    used in mini computers. But with digits from 0 to 7.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>For Example: (35)<sub>8</sub></p>
                                <br>
                                <p>4. Hexadecimal Number System: The Hexadecimal Number System uses 16 digits - alphabets 0,
                                    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, (10) A, (11) B, (12) C, (13) D, (14) E, (15) F. Base 16 Here,
                                    A to F of the Hexadecimal system means the Number 10 to 15 of the Hexadecimal Number
                                    System. Decimal Number System including respectively.</p>

                                <p>The 1's and 2's compliment of a binary number are important because we can use them for
                                    representation of negative numbers. <br> The 1's compliment of a number is found by
                                    inventing all the bits in that number.The 1's compliment system is very easy to
                                    implement merely. Using inverters.</p>

                                <p>The 2's compliment of a binary number is obtain by adding 1 to the LSB (Least Significant
                                    Bit) of 1's compliment of that number. <br> Therefore, 2's compliment is equal to 1's
                                    compliment (+) one the method of 2's compliment is Arithmetic is commonly is used in
