                        <div>
                            <p>The Study of number system is important from the viewpoint of understanding how data are represented before they can be processed by any digital system including a digital computer. It is one of the most basic topics in digital electronics. In this chapter we will discuss different number systems commonly used to represent data. We will begin the discussion with the decimal number system. <br> Although it is not important for the viewpoint of digital electronics, a brief outline of this will be given to explain some of the underlying concepts used in other number systems. This will then be followed by the more commonly used number systems such as the binary, octal and hexadecimal number systems.</p>

                                <h3>Number System:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Decimal Number System: The Decimal Number System is a radix - 10 number system an dtherfore has 10 different digits or symbols. These are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. <br> The Place value of different digits in a mixed decimal number, starting from the decimal point are 10 <sup>0</sup>, 10 <sup>1</sup>, 10 <sup>2</sup> and so on (for the integer part) and 10 <sup>-1</sup>, 10 <sup>-2</sup>, 10 <sup>-3</sup> and so on (for the fractional part). <br> The value or magnitude of a given decimal number can be expressed as the sum of the various digits multiplied by their place values or weights. <br> As an Illustration, in the case of decimal number 3586.265 the integer part (i.e. 3586) can be expressed as <br> 3586 = 6*10<sup>0</sup> + 8*10<sup>1</sup> + 5*10<sup>2</sup> + 3*10<sup>3</sup> = 6 + 80 + 500 + 3000 = 3586 and the fractional part can be expressed as 265 = 2*10<sup>-1</sup> + 6*10<sup>-2</sup> + 5*10<sup>-3</sup> = 0.2 + 0.06 + 0.005 = 0.265</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Binary Number System: The Binary System is radix - 2 number system with '0' and '1' as the two independent digits. Binary Number are 2<sup>0</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup> and so on (for the integer part) and 2<sup>-1</sup>, 2<sup>-2</sup>, 2<sup>-3</sup> and so on (for the fractional part).</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Octal Number System: The Octal Number System is the radix of the 8 and therefore has eight distinct digits. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. We make Higher Number Combination with the help of combination of these 8 numbers. In Fact, if we omit all the number containng the digits 8 or 9, or both, from the decimal number system, we end up with an octal number system. The place values for the different digits int he octal number system are 8<sup>0</sup>, 8<sup>1</sup>, 8<sup>2</sup> and so on (for the integer part) and 8<sup>-1</sup>, 8<sup>-2</sup>, 8<sup>-3</sup> and so on (for the fractional part).</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Hexadecimal Number System: The Hexadecimal number system is a radix - 16 number system and its 16 basic digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F. The place values or weights of different digits in a mixed hexadecimal number are 16<sup>0</sup>, 16<sup>1</sup>, 16<sup>2</sup> and so on (for the integer part) and 16<sup>-1</sup>, 16<sup>-2</sup>, 16<sup>-3</sup> and so on (for the fractional part). The decimal equivalent of A, B, C, D, E and F are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 respectively.</li>
